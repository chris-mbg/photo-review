# Photo review :camera:
An application created as part of my education to be a frontend developer focusing on using Firebase services in a React app :woman_technologist:

### Technologies used
* React Router
* Firebase Cloud Firestore, Firebase Auth and Firebase Storage
* React Query Firebase
* React Bootstrap and Bootstrap

### Assignment
The assignment (given in the course *JavaScript - advanced*) was to create an application where a user (photographer) can register, create albums and upload photos for customer review. The reviewer does not have to register and when he/she has choosen which photos to approve the review is confirmed. Then a new album is made on the original creators account. 

The biggest challenges in this assignment involved thinking of the best way to structure the data, functionality to upload more than one photo at once and delete functionality, both for a single photo and for a whole album. Given the time frame, the focus for me was to fulfill the user stories and specifications given and therefore the design and UI of the application leaves somewhat to be desired.
